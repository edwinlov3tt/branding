Established by a team of seasoned experts in California—a state renowned for its stringent standards in construction—we pride ourselves on bringing top-tier quality to every project. Our Journey The roots of DTP Construction began in the rigorous construction landscape of California, where the expectations for structural excellence and aesthetic precision set the bar for our operations. Recognizing a need for higher quality concrete work in Texas, our founders decided to expand eastward. Our mission was clear: to elevate the standards of finished concrete work in Texas, where we saw an opportunity to improve upon the commonly observed practices. Button What We Do At DTP Construction, we specialize in creating flawless sidewalks, driveways, and other concrete structures that stand the test of time. Unlike the commonplace uneven and unsightly finishes often seen in the area, we ensure that every project reflects the high standards we inherited from our California roots. Our attention to detail and commitment to excellence are evident in every level and smooth finish we deliver. Why Choose Us? Choosing DTP Construction means opting for a construction partner who values quality as much as you do. With our rich background and relentless pursuit of perfection, we not only meet the industry standards—we set them. Let us bring our expertise and meticulous craftsmanship to your next project, and experience the difference of working with a leader in the field.
