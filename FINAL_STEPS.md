## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If Backend Returns 502 Error

1. Check Railway logs:
   - Railway Dashboard â†’ branding service â†’ **"Logs"** tab
   - Look for error messages

2. Verify all environment variables are set:
   - Variables tab should have:
     - `NODE_ENV=production`
     - `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:...`
     - `CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-...`
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
     - `FOREPLAY_API_KEY=...`
     - `FOREPLAY_API_URL=https://public.api.foreplay.co`

3. Try redeploying:
   - Deployments tab â†’ **"..."** menu â†’ **"Redeploy"**

---

### If Frontend Can't Connect

1. Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Vercel is correct:
   - Should be: `https://branding.up.railway.app`
   - NOT: `http://...` (must be https)
   - NOT: ending with `/` (no trailing slash)

2. Redeploy frontend in Vercel

3. Clear browser cache and reload

---

### If Database Connection Fails

1. Check Railway PostgreSQL is running:
   - Dashboard â†’ PostgreSQL service â†’ should be green

2. Verify DATABASE_URL in variables:
   - Should start with `postgresql://postgres:...`

3. Check if using internal URL:
   - Internal (faster): `postgresql://postgres:...@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway`
   - External: `postgresql://postgres:...@yamanote.proxy.rlwy.net:53446/railway`

## ðŸ’° Cost Monitoring

1. Go to Railway Dashboard â†’ **Account** â†’ **Billing**
2. View **"Current Usage"** graph
