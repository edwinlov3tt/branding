# Deployment Strategy Guide

## Current Architecture Overview

Your application has a **distributed architecture** with multiple services:

### Frontend
- **Technology**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Build Output**: Static files (~2-5MB typical)

### Backend APIs
- **Count**: 12 serverless functions (currently at Vercel Hobby limit)
- **Endpoints**:
  1. `health.js` - Health check
  2. `analyze-brand-enhanced.js` - Brand analysis
  3. `brand-intelligence.js` - Brand intelligence
  4. `campaigns.js` - Campaign management
  5. `competitors.js` - Competitor data
  6. `foreplay-search.js` - Foreplay API integration
  7. `ad-inspirations.js` - Ad inspiration management
  8. `competitor-analyses.js` - Competitor analysis
  9. `products-services.js` - Product/service management
  10. `brands.js` - Brand CRUD operations
  11. `ai.js` - AI generation (largest at 14KB)
  12. `target-audiences.js` - Audience management

### External Services
- **Cloudflare Worker**: `brand-services.edwin-6f1.workers.dev` (image/content scraping)
- **PostgreSQL Database**: External database (Google Cloud SQL based on connection strings)
- **Third-party APIs**: Claude AI, OpenAI, Foreplay

const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

// Import your existing Vercel functions
const brandsHandler = require('./api/brands');
const aiHandler = require('./api/ai');
// ... import all 12

// Convert to Express routes
app.get('/api/brands', brandsHandler);
app.post('/api/ai/generate', aiHandler);
// ... add all 12 routes

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;

## Questions to Consider

1. **What's your expected traffic?**
   - < 10K requests/month ‚Üí Vercel Hobby might still work
   - 10K-100K requests/month ‚Üí Railway/Render
   - > 100K requests/month ‚Üí Consider Cloudflare or self-hosted

2. **How important is always-on?**
   - Critical ‚Üí Railway paid or Vercel Pro
   - Can tolerate sleep ‚Üí Render free tier

3. **Do you need more API endpoints in the future?**
   - Yes ‚Üí Railway/Render/self-hosted
   - No ‚Üí Stay on Vercel

4. **What's your DevOps comfort level?**
   - Beginner ‚Üí Railway or Render
   - Intermediate ‚Üí Fly.io or Cloudflare
   - Advanced ‚Üí Self-hosted VPS

5. **Budget constraint?**
   - < $10/month ‚Üí Render free or VPS
   - $10-20/month ‚Üí Railway
   - > $20/month ‚Üí Vercel Pro

---

## My Final Recommendation

**Start with Railway ($8-15/month)**

Reasons:
1. You're already at Vercel's limit
2. Need room to add more features
3. PostgreSQL is already external (easy to migrate)
4. Your `server.js` is ready to deploy
5. Predictable costs
6. Can migrate in one afternoon

**If Railway doesn't work out**, try Render's free tier to test the waters before committing to paid.

**Keep Cloudflare Worker** for image scraping - it's perfect for that use case and already working.
